                &emsp; Netflix is a household name around the world; that is no surprise. It is also not a surprise that the algorithm that is used for recommending show and movies to consumers is vastly complex. The Netflix Prize was a competition that started on October 6, 2006 and lasted until September 21, 2009. The competition was to see if anybody could design an algorithm that is more effective (at least 10% more effective, to be exact) than the one Netflix currently used for a $1 million prize.

                &emsp; In a research article published on June 23, 2014 by Ted Striphas and Blake Hallinan, the effects of this competition are closely analyzed. Hallinan and Striphas bring up a term that I have not heard: algorithmic culture. Striphas defines algorithmic culture as “… the use of computational processes to sort, classify, and hierarchize people, places, objects, and ideas, and also the habits of thought, conduct, and expression that arise in relationship to those processes.”. This essentially states that the programs and services that use data to sort peoples’ interests define algorithmic culture.

                &emsp; Before The Netflix Prize, algorithms and programs never surfaced as their own respective culture; people just looked at them as things to perform simple tasks.  Once The Netflix Prize had occurred and tens of thousands of teams consisting of programmers and non-programmers alike, people truly started realizing the impact algorithms by companies such as Google and Netflix have on culture. Algorithms and programs don’t just provide quality-of-life improvements anymore – they have an astronomical effect on cultures around the world.
