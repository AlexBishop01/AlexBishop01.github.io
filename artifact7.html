                White Hat Hacking, simply put, is hacking for the “good guys” that has an extreme impact on internet culture. As exhibited by the other artifacts in this portfolio, the internet is an extremely important aspect to both popular and high cultures across the globe. White Hat Hackers help to keep this safe to preserve the culture we have created via the Internet.

                According to King University (2019), Dan Kaminsky made his debut as a white hat hacker in 2008, when he found an extremely dangerous vulnerability in DNS protocol (which is used in basically everything related to the internet) that could have destroyed the internet as we know it if not fixed. Within a few days, he had found a patch to the bug. In finding this bug and coming up with a solution to the error, Kaminsky helped preserve our culture as an internet-dependent world.
