                Zoom has arguably had the most intense impact on our lives during the COVID-19 pandemic. Zoom not only has changed the culture of the classroom, but has changed culture in the workplace as well. From firsthand experience, I can say that Zoom calls have saved me a lot of sanity with assignments since I am always asking questions.

                According to Bob O’Donnell, a reporter for USA Today, “… the density of work environments is almost certainly going to decrease, and the implications from that move are many. When employees do start to return to the office – and those dates keep getting pushed further and further back for many organizations – some companies plan to implement rotating schedules to reduce the number of people in a given space.” This implies that the culture of the work place is being seriously impeded by this pandemic, and Zoom video calls are keeping many people employed and are the reason that many businesses are still alive.
