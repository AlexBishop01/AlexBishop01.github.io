                    &emsp; The Notre-Dame de Paris, also called the Notre Dame Cathedral, is an ancient building (built in the mid 12th century) located in Paris that is adored by many throughout the world. On April 5th, 2019, however, an accidental fire severely damaged the building and left many parts charred. This sent people from all around the world into a panic and many thought parts of this historic building were gone forever.

                    &emsp; Ubisoft, a video game developer and the creators of Assassin’s Creed: Unity, pledged help to restoration efforts with a large sum of money. While the money pledged from Ubisoft is helping immensely with restoration efforts, that’s not the only help they are providing. Assassin’s Creed: Unity is a game developed by Ubisoft, and features a life-size building of the Notre Dame. This building is a 3D render of the Notre Dame that took over 18 months to design in an attempt to get it as close as possible to the original Notre Dame. Ubisoft is giving their 3D render to the restoration team of the Notre Dame to further assist. This is one example of how a video game company is making an impact to cultural artifacts.
