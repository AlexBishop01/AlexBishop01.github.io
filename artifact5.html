                YouTube has been around since 2005, offering all different kinds of entertaining, educational, and informative content. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, this content was widely used to keep us occupied, entertained, and helped supplement our educations. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, however, the entire world has had cultural changes that has shifted people into the realm of online learning.

                “’YouTube supplements well-planned lessons that have clear instructional goals,’ said Carolyn Parker, director of the Master of Arts in Teaching Program within the School of Education at American University.” (Peter Suciu, 2020). With students being stuck at home and still completing their school work from home, YouTube has become an essential resource that complements their teacher’s lessons. Since it is extremely difficult to individually ask, say, a math teacher questions on specific problems or questions about a lecture in general, these YouTube videos could make or break a student’s grade. These changes have completely flipped our world upside down and have impacted everybody’s culture around the globe.
