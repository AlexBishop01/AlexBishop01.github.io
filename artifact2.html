                &emsp; As the fastest growing game in history, Fortnite has led the way for game culture throughout the world. According to Seamus Byrne (2019), in the first two weeks of the game being out, there was a massive 10 million players in the game. A month after that, there were 20 millions players. From the beginning, Fortnite was a game that encouraged making friends, but not even I, someone who played the game from the day it came out, would realize the impact it would make on gaming culture and popular culture as a whole.

                &emsp; From my perspective as a high school student, gaming had always seemed like a niche thing that people generally frowned upon. When Fortnite first came out, it was the same thing. After Fortnite came out on the iPhone however, people that were the ones to hate on the games picked up the game really quickly to see what all the hype was about. I really feel as though Fortnite caused people to change their opinions about video games and caused a huge shift in video gamesâ€™ impact as popular culture. To this day, Fortnite is played by millions of players at a time and is one of the top grossing games of all time. One of the greatest things about playing Fortnite is how diverse the player base is; I run into people with different cultural beliefs all the time and it is a blast to talk to them and make friends with them.
