                As the number 2 top-selling video game of all time (Wikipedia, 2020), it is no surprise to anyone that Grand Theft Auto 5 has made a huge impact on many. While the basic premise of the game is fairly simple, there are many cultural themes throughout the entire game. In Grand Theft Auto 5, you can do anything that you want to: from being a peaceful citizen following the law and rules of the road to a bank robber who commits heinous crimes on the daily.

                The main cultural theme portrayed in this video game is acculturation. GTA 5 is all about making new friends, adapting to their behaviors, and exposing yourself to new beliefs and thought processes in order to work together towards a common goal. In online missions in GTA 5, it is important to have a very intimate understanding of your teammates on the other end of the microphone so you have the best possible chance to win the mission. In addition, it is also important to understand the character you are playing as well as their thoughts and beliefs in order to have the best understanding of your characterâ€™s strengths and weaknesses. Acculturation is scattered throughout GTA 5, and from my experience, has led to making loads of new friends and has exposed me to all different kinds of cultures.
