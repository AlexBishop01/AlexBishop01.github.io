                &emsp; As a whole, the internet plays a significant role in nearly every culture. Without the internet, both popular and high culture would be significantly different than it is today. With video games such as Assassinâ€™s Creed Unity, Fortnite, and Grand Theft Auto 5, online streaming services such as Netflix and Youtube, video call software such as Zoom, and Computer Scientists like Dan Kaminsky, the internet is entertaining, educational, and safe. Everybody has parts of their culture that are different from others, but the internet is a part of a significant amount of those cultures, and it is here to stay.
